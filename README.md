# PhotoGallary

1. I realized i gave my class a bad name. I should have named it Photo instead of PhotoGallaryUser. Just to clarify it for the readablity of the code.

2. I used MS Sqlserver instead of MS sql, just running out of time to install MySql, but i don't think there is much difference.

3. The assignment was quite challenging for me since i never build React + Web API together before. The design patterns i didn't know much about and didn't imply in my work before. But i got a good understand of the unitofwork and repository pattern through the assignment.

I managed to get some result out of it but i just realize i still have a lot to learn and practice.

Thank you Daryl and Diwas:)
