# PhotoGallary

I realized i gave my class a bad name. I should have named it Photo instead of PhotoGallaryUser. Just to clarify it for the readablity of the code.
I used MS Sqlserver instead of MS sql, just running out of time to install MySql.

The assignment is a quite challenging for me. The design patterns i didn't imply in my work before. But i got a good understand of the unitofwork and repository pattern.

Great experience!
